<h1>Aron Malatinszky</h1>
<p>I'm in my third year as an undergraduate at Boston University, where I'm majoring in economics and mathematics. My passions include academic economic research, any kind of problem-solving, rigorous debate, learning languages (be it foreign or programming), and spending time with my family.</p>
