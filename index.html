<h1>Aron Malatinszky</h1>
<p>I'm a senior at Boston University, where I'll be graduating in May 2020 with a B.A. in Economics and Mathematics and a M.A. in Economics. My passions include academic economic research, any kind of problem-solving, rigorous debate, learning languages (be it foreign or programming), and spending time with my family.</p>
